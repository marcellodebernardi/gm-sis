## TEAM 31 - GARAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Software Engineering Project for Queen Mary University of London (second year, second semester). The team had to produce a complete software solution based on a document outlining requirements. Each team member received an individual grade. My **personal grade for the project was 95%**. My personal contribution to the effort was:

1. **Team leader**
2. **Designed the overall architecture** of the software (based on [Uncle Bob's clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), the architecture is an example of **domain-driven-development** and emphasizes heavily **dependency inversion**)
3. Wrote a **custom ORM framework** to completely abstract the database, found in the persistence package
4. Responsible for the **bookings module** of the software

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Do not rename the jar file. This will break the software.
2. Do not remove the GM-SIS.db file, or the lib folder
3. Do not remove the config folder or its contents
4. Do not remove the META-INF folder, or its contents.
